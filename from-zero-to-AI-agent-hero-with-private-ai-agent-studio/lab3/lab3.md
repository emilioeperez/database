# Lab 3: Create users, secure agents, and authorize agent users

## Introduction

In this lab session, you will learn how to leverage the Single Sign On (SSO) and User Management features and use them to create users and assign specific access permissions.

The **Single Sign-On (SSO)** feature allows administrators to add SSO providers and seamlessly integrate them for accessing Oracle Private AI Agent Studio. The configuration form enables the entry of key information such as Provider, Client ID, API URLs, and connection details, making it easy to enable secure, streamlined authentication for all users.

The **User Management** feature provides a centralized dashboard for managing users in Oracle Private AI Agent Studio. Administrators can view key statistics at a glance, such as the total number of users, active users, administrators, and editors.

The User Directory lists all users who have accessed the system via Single Sign-On (SSO), along with their roles, statuses, and last login details. Actions are available for managing user roles and accounts directly from this page.

**Estimated time:** 10 minutes.

### Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Configure SSO authentication in Oracle Private AI Agent Studio using OAuth credentials.
- Navigate the User Management dashboard to view, interpret, and manage user roles and access permissions within the application.

### Prerequisites

- An SSO provider and the necessary credentials (Client ID, Client Secret, Endpoint URLs, etc.) as required for OAuth integration.

## Task 1: Register SSO credentials on Oracle Private AI Agent Studio

Open Oracle Private AI Agent Studio and log in. In the sidebar, click the **SSO** section.

The 'Add Provider' button is displayed at the bottom right of the form.](images/sso_page.png)

Here, you can configure OAuth providers to enable Single Sign-On (SSO) for your organization. Complete the form with the credentials generated by your SSO provider. Required fields include:

- Client ID - `<your client ID>`
- Client Secret - `<your client secret>`
- SSO API Base URL - `<your Endpoint>`
- Access Token URL - `<your Endpoint>/oauth2/v1/token`
- Authorize URL - `<your Endpoint>/oauth2/v1/authorize`
- User URL - `<your Endpoint>/oauth2/v1/userinfo`
- Server Metadata URL - `<your Endpoint>/.well-known/openid-configuration`
- Log Out URL - `<your Endpoint>/oauth2/v1/userlogout`

Click **Add Provider**. A success message will be displayed. You can confirm the service status, disable it, or delete it on this screen.

## Task 2: Take a look at the User Management Dashboard

In the sidebar, click the **User Management** section.

Role descriptions are provided to clarify the permissions for Chat-Only Users, Editor Users and Administrators.

This page ensures user management is straightforward, secure, and tailored to your organizationâ€™s needs.

## Summary
